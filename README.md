# Project Euler Solutions

## What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems designed to be solved with computer programs. The problems encourage efficient problem solving and algorithmic thinking, often requiring both mathematical insight and programming skills.

This repository contains Python solutions to problems from Project Euler. Each problem is implemented as a standalone script for clarity and ease of execution.

## Problems Solved

- **Problem 1:** Multiples of 3 or 5  
- **Problem 2:** Even Fibonacci Numbers  
- **Problem 3:** Largest Prime Factor  
- **Problem 4:** Largest Palindrome Product  
- **Problem 5:** Smallest Multiple  

Solutions follow clean and readable Python practices. More problems will be added over time.

## How to Run

```bash
python "filename.py"
```

Replace `"filename.py"` with the desired problem script.
